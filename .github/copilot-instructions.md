Please always read the repository's `AGENTS.md` and `README.md` before making any changes.

Key rules:
- Open and re-read `AGENTS.md` in full when you see the exact phrase "please read AGENTS.md" in a user's message.
- Verify documentation and repository conventions in `README.md` before creating or modifying files.
- If a requested change conflicts with `AGENTS.md`, explicitly explain the conflict and propose a compliant alternative.

These instructions are for automated assistants and contributors using GitHub Copilot or similar tools.
